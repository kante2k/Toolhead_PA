## Overview

Pressure advance is a technique used to compensate for the lag in extrusion response in 3D printers. It adjusts the flow of filament to ensure smoother and more accurate prints, particularly in high-speed scenarios.

## Implementation

The implementation of pressure advance can vary across different firmware and slicers. Generally, it involves adjusting the firmware settings to optimize the extrusion process during rapid movements.

## Benefits

Implementing pressure advance can lead to:

- Improved print quality
- Reduced stringing and oozing
- Enhanced layer adhesion

## Settings

Common settings for pressure advance include:
- Pressure Advance Factor
- Minimum Extrusion Time
- Retract Settings

For optimal results, it may require some experimentation to find the best values for a specific printer configuration.
